      <h2>World War I - The Great War</h2>
      <p>World War I (1914–1918) was a global conflict involving the Allied Powers (France, Britain, Russia, later the U.S.) and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire). The war began after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in 1914. Militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism fueled the conflict, resulting in trench warfare and modernized weapons like tanks and aircraft.</p>
      <p>The Treaty of Versailles ended the war, imposing severe penalties on Germany and reshaping Europe’s political landscape. The war left 16 million dead and 21 million wounded, marking it as one of history’s deadliest conflicts.</p>

      <h2>World War II - The Second Global Conflict</h2>
      <p>World War II (1939–1945) involved the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy, Japan) and the Allied Powers (United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France). It began with Germany’s invasion of Poland in 1939, driven by Adolf Hitler’s aggressive expansionist policies. The war spanned continents, witnessing events like the Holocaust, D-Day, and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
      <p>World War II ended with the surrender of Germany and Japan, leaving an estimated 70–85 million dead. The aftermath reshaped global politics, with the United Nations established to prevent future conflicts and the Cold War beginning between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.</p>
